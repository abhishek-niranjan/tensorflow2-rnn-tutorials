The tutorial notebooks in this repository are aimed to help beginners program basic recurrent neural networks(RNNs) for textual problems in tensorflow-2. 

## Prerequisite 
  * Understanding of basic textual processing methods, i.e familiarity with tokenization, etc.
  * Functioning of basic RNN, GRU, LSTM cells
  * Fundamentals of RNN based Encoder-Decoder Architectures 
  * Attention mechanism, mainly [Bahdanau Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) and [Luong Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
  * A basic idea of beam search algorithm.
